        <h2 class="card__title"><b>HUNT FOR NORTHERN LIGHTS :</b><br>
          Go north. In northern Lapland the lights shine about every other clear night between September and March. In southern Finland they are visible on about 10-20 nights a year.Look to the stars. If you notice that the night sky is clear and starry, your chances of seeing the northern lights are good.Stay outside. The lights might unexpectedly appear and just as suddenly vanish any time from just after sunset to just before dawn. Bright auroral displays can even light up the snowy arctic landscape enough to help skiers find the way home.</h2>
